I can try to write a short lesson on Metal Shading Language, but it will not cover everything you need to know. Here is an outline of what I will cover:

- What is Metal Shading Language and why use it?
- How to set up a Metal project in Xcode and create a Metal device
- How to create a Metal layer and a command queue
- How to write shader functions in MSL and compile them
- How to create a vertex buffer and a render pipeline
- How to encode commands and draw a triangle

If you want to follow along, you will need an Apple device with an A7 chip or later, Xcode 10 or later, and Swift 4.2 or later. You will also need some basic knowledge of C++, graphics programming, and parallel computing.

Let's begin!

## What is Metal Shading Language and why use it?

Metal Shading Language (MSL) is a C++-based language that allows you to write programs that run on the graphics processing unit (GPU) of Apple devices¹²⁴⁵. MSL is a unified language that enables tighter integration between graphics and compute programs¹³⁵. MSL programs can perform tasks such as rendering 3D graphics, processing images and videos, and accelerating machine learning algorithms.

Metal Shading Language is part of the Metal framework, which is Apple's low-level API for interacting with 3D graphics hardware. Metal provides a thin layer above the GPU, which means that it offers improved speed and low overhead compared to using OpenGL ES. However, it also means that you have to write more code and manage more details yourself.

Using MSL gives you full power and control over how your app works with the GPU. You can optimize your code for performance, customize your rendering effects, and leverage the latest features of Apple hardware. However, using MSL also requires you to have a good understanding of how the GPU works, how to write shader code, and how to use the Metal framework and tools.

## How to set up a Metal project in Xcode and create a Metal device

To use MSL, you need to create a Metal project in Xcode. You can use any template that supports Metal, such as Game or Single View App. For this lesson, we will use the Single View App template.

To create a new project:

1. Launch Xcode and choose File ▸ New ▸ Project.
2. Select iOS ▸ Application ▸ Single View App and click Next.
3. Enter a name for your project, such as "MetalLesson", and choose Swift as the language. Make sure Use Core Data and Include Tests are unchecked.
4. Choose a location for your project and click Create.

You should see a project navigator on the left side of Xcode with some files. The most important ones are:

- AppDelegate.swift: This file contains the code that runs when your app launches and handles app events.
- ViewController.swift: This file contains the code that controls the main view of your app.
- Main.storyboard: This file contains the graphical interface of your app.

To use Metal in your app, you need to get a reference to an MTLDevice. An MTLDevice represents the GPU that your app will use for rendering and computing. You can get an MTLDevice by calling MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice(), which returns the default device for your system.

To get an MTLDevice:

1. Open ViewController.swift and add an import statement for Metal at the top of the file:

```swift
import UIKit
import Metal // Add this line
```

2. Add a property for storing the device reference inside the ViewController class:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

  var device: MTLDevice! // Add this line

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
  }
}
```

3. In viewDidLoad(), assign the default device to the device property:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() // Add this line
}
```

Now you have an MTLDevice that you can use for creating other Metal objects.

## How to create a Metal layer and a command queue

To render anything with Metal, you need two things: a CAMetalLayer and an MTLCommandQueue.

A CAMetalLayer has a property called nextDrawable, which returns a CAMetalDrawable object. A CAMetalDrawable contains a texture that you can draw into using Metal. The CAMetalLayer then displays the texture on screen.

An MTLCommandQueue is an object that manages a queue of commands that you want to execute on the GPU. You can create commands by using MTLCommandBuffer and MTLCommandEncoder objects, which we will see later. The MTLCommandQueue ensures that the commands are executed in the order that you submit them.

To create a CAMetalLayer and an MTLCommandQueue:

1. Add two properties for storing the layer and the queue references inside the ViewController class:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

  var device: MTLDevice!
  var metalLayer: CAMetalLayer! // Add this line
  var commandQueue: MTLCommandQueue! // Add this line

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()
  }
}
```

2. In viewDidLoad(), create a new CAMetalLayer and assign it to the metalLayer property:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer() // Add this line
}
```

3. Set the device of the metalLayer to be the same as the device property:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer()
  metalLayer.device = device // Add this line
}
```

4. Set the pixel format of the metalLayer to be .bgra8Unorm, which means that each pixel has four components (blue, green, red, alpha) in unsigned normalized integer format:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer()
  metalLayer.device = device
  metalLayer.pixelFormat = .bgra8Unorm // Add this line
}
```

5. Set the frame of the metalLayer to match the bounds of the main view:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer()
  metalLayer.device = device
  metalLayer.pixelFormat = .bgra8Unorm
  metalLayer.frame = view.layer.frame // Add this line
}
```

6. Add the metalLayer as a sublayer of the main view's layer:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer()
  metalLayer.device = device
  metalLayer.pixelFormat = .bgra8Unorm
  metalLayer.frame = view.layer.frame
  view.layer.addSublayer(metalLayer) // Add this line
}
```

7. Create a new command queue from the device and assign it to the commandQueue property:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

  device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

  metalLayer = CAMetalLayer()
  metalLayer.device = device
  metalLayer.pixelFormat = .bgra8Unorm
  metalLayer.frame = view.layer.frame
  view.layer.addSublayer(metalLayer)

  commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue() // Add this line
}
```

Now you have a Metal layer and a command queue that you can use for rendering graphics with Metal.

## How to write shader functions in MSL and compile them

Shader functions are small programs that run on the GPU and perform various tasks related to rendering graphics. For example, a vertex shader function takes a vertex as input and outputs its position and other attributes. A fragment shader function takes a fragment (a potential pixel) as input and outputs its color and other attributes.

Shader functions are written in Metal Shading Language (MSL), which is a subset of C++ with some extensions and restrictions. MSL has some built-in types and functions that are specific to graphics programming, such as vector, matrix, texture and sampler types.

To use shader functions in your app, you need to compile them into a library that can be accessed by the Metal framework. You can use the Metal compiler (metallib) to compile MSL source files into a library file, or you can use the MTLLibrary class to compile MSL source code at runtime.

For this lesson, we will use the MTLLibrary class to compile our shader functions. This way, we can write our shader code in the same playground as our Swift code.

To write and compile shader functions:

1. Create a multi-line string containing the shader code and add it to your playground:

```swift
let shader = """
#include <metal_stdlib>
using namespace metal;

struct VertexIn {
  float4 position [[attribute(0)]];
};

vertex float4 vertex_main(const VertexIn vertex_in [[stage_in]]) {
  return vertex_in.position;
}

fragment float4 fragment_main() {
  return float4(1, 0, 0, 1);
}
"""
```

This string defines two shader functions: vertex_main and fragment_main. The vertex_main function takes a VertexIn struct as input and returns its position as output. The VertexIn struct has one attribute: position, which is a float4 (a vector of four floats). The position attribute is annotated with [[attribute(0)]], which means that it corresponds to the first attribute of the vertex buffer that we will create later.

The fragment_main function takes no input and returns a constant color as output: red (1, 0, 0, 1). The color is also a float4, where the first three components are the red, green and blue values, and the last component is the alpha value.

Both shader functions are annotated with [[stage_in]] and [[stage_out]], which indicate that they are entry points for the vertex and fragment stages of the rendering pipeline.

2. Create a new MTLLibrary from the device by passing the shader string as an argument:

```swift
let library = try device.makeLibrary(source: shader, options: nil)
```

This line creates a new MTLLibrary object that contains the compiled shader functions. If there is any error in compiling the shader code, it will throw an exception.

3. Get references to the vertex and fragment functions from the library by using their names:

```swift
let vertexFunction = library.makeFunction(name: "vertex_main")
let fragmentFunction = library.makeFunction(name: "fragment_main")
```

These lines create two MTLFunction objects that represent the vertex and fragment functions. You can use these objects to create a render pipeline later.

Now you have written and compiled your shader functions in MSL.

## How to create a vertex buffer and a render pipeline

A vertex buffer is an object that stores an array of vertices that define the shape of an object. A vertex is a point in 3D space that has some attributes, such as position, color, texture coordinates and so on. A vertex buffer is a type of MTLBuffer, which is a general-purpose object that stores data in the GPU memory.

A render pipeline is an object that describes how to render graphics using Metal. A render pipeline consists of two parts: a render pipeline state and a render pipeline descriptor. A render pipeline state is an immutable object that contains the configuration of the rendering pipeline, such as the shader functions, the pixel format, the blending mode and so on. A render pipeline descriptor is a mutable object that specifies the parameters for creating a render pipeline state.

To create a vertex buffer and a render pipeline:

1. Define an array of vertices that represent a triangle:

```swift
let vertices = [
  Vertex(position: [-0.5, -0.5]),
  Vertex(position: [ 0.5, -0.5]),
  Vertex(position: [ 0.0,  0.5])
]
```

This array contains three Vertex structs, each with a position attribute that is a float2 (a vector of two floats). The position attribute defines the x and y coordinates of the vertex in normalized device coordinates (NDC), which range from -1 to 1 in both axes. The origin (0, 0) is at the center of the screen.

2. Define a struct for representing a vertex in Swift:

```swift
struct Vertex {
  var position: vector_float2
}
```

This struct matches the VertexIn struct that we defined in MSL earlier. It has one attribute: position, which is a vector_float2 (a type alias for simd_float2).

3. Calculate the size of the vertex buffer by multiplying the size of one vertex by the number of vertices:

```swift
let vertexBufferSize = MemoryLayout<Vertex>.stride * vertices.count
```

This line uses the MemoryLayout struct to get the size (in bytes) of one Vertex struct, and then multiplies it by the number of vertices in the array.

4. Create a new MTLBuffer from the device by passing the vertex data and size as arguments:

```swift
let vertexBuffer = device.makeBuffer(bytes: vertices, length: vertexBufferSize, options: [])
```

This line creates a new MTLBuffer object that contains the vertex data copied from the vertices array. The options argument specifies some flags for creating the buffer, such as storage mode and cache mode. We pass an empty array to use the default options.

5. Create a new MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor and assign the vertex and fragment functions to it:

```swift
let renderPipelineDescriptor = MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor()
renderPipelineDescriptor.vertexFunction = vertexFunction
renderPipelineDescriptor.fragmentFunction = fragmentFunction
```

This line creates a new MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor object that specifies the parameters for creating a render pipeline state. We assign the vertexFunction and fragmentFunction objects that we created earlier to it.

6. Set the pixel format of the color attachment to match the pixel format of the metal layer:

```swift
renderPipelineDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].pixelFormat = metalLayer.pixelFormat
```

This line sets the pixel format of the first color attachment of the render pipeline descriptor to be .bgra8Unorm, which is the same as the pixel format of the metal layer. A color attachment is an output destination for rendering graphics, such as a texture or a layer.

7. Create a new MTLRenderPipelineState from the device by passing the render pipeline descriptor as an argument:

```swift
let renderPipelineState = try device.makeRenderPipelineState(descriptor: renderPipelineDescriptor)
```

This line creates a new MTLRenderPipelineState object that contains the configuration of the rendering pipeline based on the render pipeline descriptor. If there is any error in creating the render pipeline state, it will throw an exception.

Now you have created a vertex buffer and a render pipeline that you can use for rendering graphics with Metal.

## How to encode commands and draw a triangle

The final step in rendering graphics with Metal is to encode commands and submit them to the command queue. Commands are instructions that tell the GPU what to do, such as clearing the screen, setting the render pipeline state, drawing vertices and presenting the drawable.

To encode commands, you need to use MTLCommandBuffer and MTLCommandEncoder objects. A MTLCommandBuffer is an object that stores a list of commands that you want to execute on the GPU. A MTLCommandEncoder is an object that helps you create commands and add them to a command buffer. There are different types of command encoders for different types of commands, such as MTLRenderCommandEncoder for rendering commands and MTLComputeCommandEncoder for compute commands.

To encode commands and draw a triangle:

1. Create a new MTLCommandBuffer from the command queue:

```swift
let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer()
```

This line creates a new MTLCommandBuffer object that will store the commands that we want to execute on the GPU.

2. Get a CAMetalDrawable from the metal layer by calling nextDrawable():

```swift
let drawable = metalLayer.nextDrawable()
```

This line gets a CAMetalDrawable object from the metal layer. A CAMetalDrawable contains a texture that we can draw into using Metal. The metal layer then displays the texture on screen.

3. Create a new MTLRenderPassDescriptor and set its color attachment properties:

```swift
let renderPassDescriptor = MTLRenderPassDescriptor()
renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].texture = drawable.texture
renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].loadAction = .clear
renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].storeAction = .store
renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].clearColor = MTLClearColor(red: 0, green: 0.5, blue: 1, alpha: 1)
```

This line creates a new MTLRenderPassDescriptor object that specifies how to configure a render pass. A render pass is a group of rendering commands that share the same output destinations and settings.

We set the texture of the first color attachment of the render pass descriptor to be the texture of the drawable. We also set the load action to .clear, which means that we want to clear the texture before rendering anything. We set the store action to .store, which means that we want to store the rendered result in the texture after rendering. We also set the clear color to be cyan (0, 0.5, 1, 1), which is the color that we want to use for clearing the texture.

4. Create a new MTLRenderCommandEncoder from the command buffer by passing the render pass descriptor as an argument:

```swift
let renderCommandEncoder = commandBuffer.makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor: renderPassDescriptor)
```

This line creates a new MTLRenderCommandEncoder object that helps us create rendering commands and add them to the command buffer. We pass the render pass descriptor as an argument to specify how to configure the render pass.

5. Set the render pipeline state of the render command encoder to be the render pipeline state that we created earlier:

```swift
renderCommandEncoder.setRenderPipelineState(renderPipelineState)
```

This line sets the render pipeline state of the render command encoder to be the render pipeline state that we created earlier. This tells the GPU which shader functions, pixel format, blending mode and so on to use for rendering.

6. Set the vertex buffer of the render command encoder at index 0:

```swift
renderCommandEncoder.setVertexBuffer(vertexBuffer, offset: 0, index: 0)
```

This line sets the vertex buffer of the render command encoder at index 0. This tells the GPU which vertex buffer to use for drawing vertices. The offset argument specifies how many bytes to skip from the start of the buffer. We pass 0 because we want to use all of the vertices in the buffer.

7. Draw a triangle using three vertices from index 0:

```swift
renderCommandEncoder.drawPrimitives(type: .triangle, vertexStart: 0, vertexCount: 3)
```

This line draws a triangle using three vertices from index 0 of the vertex buffer. The type argument specifies which type of primitive to draw. A primitive is a basic shape that can be drawn by connecting vertices, such as a point, a line or a triangle.

8. End encoding with the render command encoder:

```swift
renderCommandEncoder.endEncoding()
```

This line ends encoding with the render command encoder and adds all of the rendering commands to the command buffer.

9. Present the drawable when the command buffer is completed:

```swift
commandBuffer.present(drawable)
```

This line tells the command buffer to present the drawable on screen when it is completed. This means that the metal layer will display the texture of the drawable after all of the rendering commands are executed.

10. Commit the command buffer to the command queue:

```swift
commandBuffer.commit()
```

This line commits the command buffer to the command queue. This means that the command queue will execute all of the commands in the command buffer on the GPU.

Now you have encoded commands and drawn a triangle with Metal.
